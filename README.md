# Drum HAT

Oooh err, you've caught me! I've been busy helping out with production and haven't quite got the Drum HAT software up to speed yet.

However, you can install it like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/drum-hat
cd drum-hat/library
sudo python setup.py install
```

Or, for Python 3:

```
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/drum-hat
cd drum-hat/library
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
